   MIRROR.PL README
   
   ################

This tool is used to mirror set of files from one place to other.
It's designed to maintain chroot environments and be able to pack
a program or a set of ones managing library dependencies and so.
You can use mirror.pl as a way to maintain system backups for
configuration files or transfering them between different systems.
You can also mix multiple packaging systems on a single script.

mirror.pl also supports different packaging systems. Actually:

 - pkgsrc
 - portage
 - debian

Mirroring rules are written into a single file with one rule per
line. Commands are just one or two characters. This is:

  #   comment         ignores the rest of the line
  :   global setup    see options below
  @   copy package    copies the files of a package
  @-  remove package  removes the files of a package found in the target dir
  +   copy file       copy a file to the target directory
  -   remove file     removes a file from the target directory
  !   shell scape     runs a single command


Options:
--------
This is the list of available setup commands. These ones are the started
with ':' and are used to change global setups.

  :libs     - follow and copy required libs for binaries
  :verb     - be verbose while working
  :into     - *NOT YET IMPLEMENTED*
  :pkgsrc   - following '@' commands will refer to pkgsrc packages
  :debian   - "" same for debian packages
  :gentoo   - "" same for portage

This is a sample script to create and maintain a simple jail environment
used on a FreeBSD/pkgsrc box:

---------8<--------------
:pkgsrc
:libs
#:verb
@bash
@vim
@vim-share
@-screen
#@ncurses
+/usr/pkg/share/terminfo
+/etc/termcap
+/bin
+/usr/bin/clear
+/usr/bin/whoami
!mkdir -p tmp libexec home
!cp -f /libexec/ld-elf.so.1 libexec/   # FreeBSD specific
---------8<--------------


The way to run this program is:

$ perl mirror.pl
use ./me [rulesfile] [rootpath]

$ mkdir root/
$ perl mirror.pl chroot.mir root/


Have fun!
