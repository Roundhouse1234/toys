gera - v1.08 - Nov 17, 2004
 fixed a bug in Variable (leading to a bug in IfInlineEgg)
 added long conditional jumps
 setString() now uses a call over the string and pop to set the string when
    the string is long enough to justify it - thanks spoonm
gera - v1.07 - Sep 1, 2004
 inner eggs can now inherit syscall's symbols (useful for WindowsSyscall)
 added paramer leave to freeStack() (how many words to leave in the stack)
 fixed a bug which was unbalancing the stack
 renamed setVarPtr() to setRegFromVarPtr()
 
gera - v1.06 - Jun 16, 2004
 added __iadd__() to InlineEgg. Now, instead of doing egg.addCode(X)
    you can do egg += X. Which leads to cleaner and nicer code :-)
 added subValue() and addValue() to Microx86, you can do
    egg += egg.micro.addValue('eax',1234), for example

gera - v1.05
 example1.py, README and InlineEgg.html
    changed it to execute "/bin/ls -la" instead of "/bin/sh -i". Now it's
     easier to test.

gera - v1.04
 Microx86:
    incReg and decReg track the changes in the registers. This is a bug fix,
     not only an optimization: incorrect tracking was introducing bugs when
     assuming incorrect values for registers.
 InlineEgg, Linuxx86Syscall, OpenBSDx86Syscall:
    inet_addr and make_sockaddr moved from InlineEgg to the OS dependant
    classes, because there are differences from os to os. Solaris
    implementation is still missing (I just forgot to do it).
 InlineEgg:
    fork() just a comment
    write() suggestion from Philippe Biondi, write() can be used with just two
     arguments, in which case the count to write is len(buf)
    fcntl() added
    ptrace() fixes in handling arguments
    prctl() added
    added a way to call any syscall if it's defined in the syscall class
     (read the code for InlineEgg.__getattr__())
    
gera - v1.03
 WindowsSyscall:
    added the method initResolver(), which will walk the linked lists of loaded
     modules to find the adresses of kernel32.dll, GetProcAddress() and
     LoadLibraryA().

gera - v1.02
 WindowsSyscall:
    fixed a missing microClass field

gera - v1.01
 Makefile: added $(VERSION)
    added Changelog
    added InlineEgg.html
 inlinegg: added Syscall.microClass
    removed microClass from InlineEgg.__init__()
    added Microx86.nop()
    added InlinEgg.dumpBin()
    renamed InlineEgg.popReg() to pop(), and fixed a bug in it.
    added Microx86.pushString(), this makes InlineEgg.save() work with strings
 examples: added example6.py (getAndExecuteEgg(). It will download a file
    from a URL, save it and execute it.
